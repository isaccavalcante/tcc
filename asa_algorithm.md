# ASA Algorithm :us:

```
If a host sends an outbound ARP message:
    If the ARP message is an outbound `ARP request`:
        If the IP address in the outbound `ARP request` corresponds to the gateway's IP address: /* Case 4 */
            ASA broadcasts the outbound `ARP request` to the gateway.
        else,
            ASA reports the outbound `ARP request` to a user of the host.
            If source is identified and approved by the user: /* Case 3 */
                ASA broadcasts the outbound `ARP request` to the source.
            else,
                ASA drops the outboound `ARP request`.
    else, If the ARP message is an outbound `ARP reply`: /* Cases 2 and 4 */
        ASA broadcasts the outbound ARP Reply. /* ASA broadcasts the outbound ARP reply only once within random timeout values in Case 2*/
